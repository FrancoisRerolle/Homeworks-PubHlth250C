\section{\small{Question: \textit{Using the Kaplan-Meier plots, graphically assess the relationship between baseline smoking status and time to death. Briefly interpret what you see. In 1-2 sentences describe the limitations of this approach. [include graph, labeled Figure 1] (10 points)}}} 

Figure \ref{fig:one} below shows the Kaplan-Meier empirical survival plots by baseline smoking category. As we can see, it looks like the survival function for smokers, in orange, decreases faster than for non-smokers, in blue. Graphically, we would say that smokers have an increased risk of death compared to non-smokers in this dataset. Yet, given the overlap of the 95 $\%$ confidence intervals, it is unlikely that this observed difference is statistically significant (nor substantively significant).\\\\
Plotting the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each level of categorical variables is a simple way to assess if such covariate is associated with survival, but this approach is limited as it becomes very cumbersome with multiple categorical variables and is not an option for continuous variables. Furthermore, this Kaplan-Meier approach does not give an estimate of the magnitude of the effect of a covariate on survival, nor is there a formal test to assess the difference between the two groups.

\section{\small{Question: \textit{Referring to the code from lecture, are you able to calculate the overall median survival time in this case? If so, provide an estimate of this quantity, if not, describe why and provide an estimate of the 75th percentile of survival time. Interpret the quantity that you estimated. (15 points)}}} 

Figure \ref{fig:two} shows the overall Kaplan-Meier survival curve. As we can see, we can't estimate the overall median survival time in this case as less than $50\%$ of the individuals in the sample died by the end of the follow-up. Actually, at the end of the follow-up, survival was still above $65\%$.\\\\
On the other hand, the overall 75th percentile of survival time can be calculated and is equal to \(\Sexpr{round(KMtable[which(KMtable[,"surv"] <=0.75),][1,1],1)}\) years. That means that by year \(\Sexpr{round(KMtable[which(KMtable[,"surv"] <=0.75),][1,1],1)}\), $25\%$ of the individuals in the sample had died (75$\%$ survived).

\section{\small{Question: \textit{Answer the following questions about the log-rank test: (10 points total)}}} 

\subsection{\small{\textit{Describe the specific hypothesis that the log-rank test is considering here.}}} 

Here, we are comparing the survival curves between two groups, baseline smokers and baseline non-smokers. The log-rank test tests the null hypothesis that the two survival functions are equivalent at all time points:
\begin{eqnarray*}
H_{0}: \forall t > 0, S_{smokers}(t)=S_{non-smokers}(t)
\label{eq:nullHypothesisLogRank}
\end{eqnarray*}
where $S_{smokers}(t)$ and $S_{non-smokers}(t)$ are the survival functions of baseline smokers and non-smokers respectively. The alternative hypothesis for the log-rank test is that the two survival functions differ in at least one time point: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
H_{A}:  S_{smokers}(t)\neq S_{non-smokers}(t), \mbox{ for some t}
\label{eq:alternativeHypothesisLogRank}
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{\small{\textit{What do you conclude from this test (use $5\%$ significance criteria)? What is the limitation of the inference that you obtain from the log-rank test?}}} 
The result from the log-rank test is given below. At the $5\%$ significance level, the test is not significant (p=0.088) and fails to reject the null hypothesis that the two survival functions are equivalent. We therefore conclude that the data does not provide evidence for different survival functions between baseline smokers and non-smokers.\\\\
One big limitation of the inferences obtained from log-rank tests is that it is limited to categorical variable comparisons, and for multiple stratum comparisons, the statistically significant log-rank test will only indicate that at least two of the stratum-specific survival functions are not equivalent but will not indicate which ones. In addition, the log-rank test does not give any information about the magnitude of the difference between two survival curves, and the log-rank test can't simultaneously test for differences in survival for multiple predictors.

\section{\small{Question: \textit{Answer the following questions about the Cox models estimated above: (20 points total)}}} 

\subsection{\small{\textit{Why do we use specialized methods for survival analysis (instead of linear or logistic regression, for example)?}}} 

Because of right-censoring and variable follow-up times for the study population, we cannot use methods like simple linear or logistic regression. Right-censoring means we lack data on whether the outcome occurred for those individuals, so we can’t estimate a meaningful continuous outcome using time-to-event. With variable follow-up times, we would need to either pick an arbitrary cut-off time for analysis (e.g. all those who had had the event by that cut point) for a binary outcome, but that would mean we would lose a lot of information.

\subsection{\small{\textit{What are the advantages of the Cox model over other survival analysis methods? What is a potential disadvantage of the Cox model?}}} 

The main advantage of the Cox model over other survival analysis methods is that it does not impose any assumptions on the ``baseline'' hazard (referent hazard) allowing very flexible models (compared to fully parametric models). Cox models are robust because the referent hazard is not subject to misspecification, and often this loss of precision is not great. That is why it is called a semi-parametric model. On the other hand, correctly specifying the distribution of the baseline hazard could yield a more efficient estimator. Sir Cox himself would have rather used a parametric model over his own Cox model.

\subsection{\small{\textit{What assumptions, if any, does the standard Cox proportional hazards model make?}}} 

Proportional hazards regression assumes that the hazards are proportional for all covariates in the model, which implies that all of our covariates do not vary over time. The Cox model also assumes a linear relationship between the log of the hazard rate and the covariates in the model.

\subsection{\small{\textit{Compare the test of the smoking-mortality association between the log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model. What do you observe? Between these two, which one would you
prefer, and why?}}} 

The p-value for the smoking-mortality association in the unadjusted Cox proportional hazards model (see below) is $0.088$ which is almost identical to the p-value obtained for the log-rank test in question 3, both failing to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in mortality by baseline smoking status.\\\\
On the other hand, in the adjusted Cox model, the test of the smoking-mortality association is now significant (p-value = $4.23e^{-10}$), indicating a statistically significant difference between smokers and nonsmokers for mortality.\\\\
As previously discussed, the log-rank test is not flexible enough to account for many variables, especially continuous variables. Our conceptualization of the research question led us to draw a DAG where age, sex and education were potential confounders and we need to adjust for them if we want to retrieve the causal effect of smoking on survival. We would therefore prefer to use the Cox model over the log-rank test.\\\\

\section{\small{Question: \textit{Write the equation for the log-hazard function for the adjusted model you estimated in terms of the variables in the dataset. Clearly define all parameters in the model. (15 points)}}} 

The equation for the log-hazard function for the adjusted model is given by:

\begin{eqnarray*}
ln(h(t|x)) = ln(h_{0}(t)) + \beta_{smoke} * cursmoke + \beta_{sex} * sex + \beta_{age} * age\\ + \beta_{educ,2} * educ_{2} + \beta_{educ,3} * educ_{3} + \beta_{educ,4} * educ_{4}
\label{eq:alogHazardFunctionAdjusted}
\end{eqnarray*}
where 

\begin{itemize}
\item $h(t)$ is the hazard function and represents the instantaneous (very short-term) rate of failure/mortality among those who have not had the event, 
\item $h_{0}(t)$ represents the baseline hazard (the rate of event at time $t$ with all x=0); this is not specified under the Cox model, 
\item $cursmoke$ is a binary indicator equal to 1 or 0 for baseline smokers and non-smokers respectively, 
\item $sex$ is a binary indicator equals to 1 or 2 for male and female respectively, 
\item $age$ is a continuous variable for age (in years) and,
\item $educ_{j}$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 for individuals with a categorized education level in the $j^{th}$ category (1 as referent category). 
\item $\beta_{smoke}$ is the log-hazard ratio for mortality comparing baseline smokers to baseline non-smokers, holding the values of the other predictors constant.
\item $\beta_{sex}$ is the log-hazard ratio for mortality comparing females to males, holding the values of the other predictors constant.
\item $\beta_{age}$ is the log-hazard ratio for mortality for a 1-unit increase in age, holding the values of the other predictors constant.
\item $\beta_{educ,2}$ is the log-hazard ratio for mortality comparing high school/GED to some high school, holding the values of the other predictors constant.
\item $\beta_{educ,3}$ is the log-hazard ratio for mortality comparing some college/vocational school to some high school, holding the values of the other predictors constant.
\item $\beta_{educ,4}$ is the log-hazard ratio for mortality comparing college to some high school, holding the values of the other predictors constant.
\end{itemize}

\section{\small{Question: \textit{Using the above, show that the hazard ratio comparing current smokers to non-smokers, holding all other covariates constant, is exp($\beta_{1}$) where $\beta_{1}$ is the coefficient on the smoking indicator. (Hint: Start by showing the log-hazard for smokers and the log-hazard for non-smokers and use the fact that the log of the hazard ratio is the difference between two log-hazards.) (10 points)}}} 

The log of the hazard ($h_{s}(t)$) for smokers ($cursmoke$ = 1) is given by:

\begin{eqnarray*}
ln(h_{s}(t|x)) = ln(h_{0}(t)) + \beta_{smoke} + \beta_{sex} * sex + \beta_{age} * age\\ + \beta_{educ,2} * educ_{2} + \beta_{educ,3} * educ_{3} + \beta_{educ,4} * educ_{4}
\label{eq:logHazardFunctionAdjustedSmokers}
\end{eqnarray*}
The log of the hazard ($h_{ns}(t)$) for non smokers ($cursmoke$ = 0) is given by:

\begin{eqnarray*}
ln(h_{ns}(t|x)) = ln(h_{0}(t)) + \beta_{sex} * sex + \beta_{age} * age\\ + \beta_{educ,2} * educ_{2} + \beta_{educ,3} * educ_{3} + \beta_{educ,4} * educ_{4}
\label{eq:logHazardFunctionAdjustedNonSmokers}
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, taking the difference of the two equations, holding all other covariates constant, we have:

\begin{eqnarray*}
ln(h_{s}(t|x)) - ln(h_{ns}(t|x)) = ln(\dfrac{h_{s}(t|x)}{h_{ns}(t|x)}) = \beta_{smoke}
\label{eq:logHazardRatioSmoking}
\end{eqnarray*}
Noting $\beta_{smoke}=\beta_{1}$ the coefficient for smoking and $HR_{smoking} = \dfrac{h_{s}(t|x)}{h_{ns}(t|x)}$, the hazard ratio comparing current smokers to non-smokers, we have:

\begin{eqnarray*}
HR_{smoking} = \dfrac{h_{s}(t|x)}{h_{ns}(t|x)} = exp(\beta_{1})
\label{eq:HazardRatioSmoking}
\end{eqnarray*}
QED.

\section{\small{Question: \textit{Complete the following table. How would you interpret the parameter estimate that compares smokers to non-smokers in the adjusted model? What measure of association common in epidemiologic research does this correspond to? (10 points)}}}

\caption{Crude and adjusted hazard ratio (HR) estimates of the association between baseline smoking status and mortality. Framingham Cohort Study. 1948-1972, Framingham, MA.}
\label{table:table1}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\noindent After adjusting for sex, age and education level, smokers have\ $1.40$ (95 $\%$ CI: \(\Sexpr{hr.adj.expci[1,2]}\) - \(\Sexpr{hr.adj.expci[1,3]}\)) times the hazard of dying than non smokers. Our estimate assumes non-informative censoring, and because our outcome is all-cause morality, we do not have to worry about competing events. The hazard ratios correspond to instantaneous incidence rate ratio, a common measure of association in epidemiologic research. The hazard function relates to the \textit{rate} over an infintesmally small interval from time $t$ to time $t+\delta$ given survival until time $t$. From the hazard function, one can compute the cumulative risk, although as the Vittinghoff textbook puts it: ``it is important to keep in mind the definition of the hazard as a short-term rate and distinguish risk in this sense from cumulative risk over a defined follow-up period''. 

\section{\small{Question: \textit{Is there evidence for a violation of the proportional hazards assumption in any of the variables? Indicate how you arrived at your conclusion. Describe how you would account for any noted violations in the proportional hazards assumption. (10 points)}}} 

To assess any violation for the proportional hazards assumptions, we fitted a Cox model with interaction terms between each of the covariates (dummy variables for $educ$ were previously created) and linear follow-up time. A non-null interaction coefficient would suggest that the effect of the corresponding covariate is not constant over time, hence violating the PH assumption. As we can see on the output below, only the interaction coefficient with $sex$ reached statistical significance (p-value = 0.026) indicating violation of the PH assumption that there is a constant hazard ratio over time for $sex$. There is no evidence to reject the PH assumptions for all the other covariates nor the exposure of interest $cursmoke$.\\\\
To account for such violation in the proportional hazards assumption, we could include the time interaction with $sex$ in the final model or, since $sex$ is categorical, we could estimate a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, allowing the baseline hazard $h_{0}(t)$ to differ between males and females.
